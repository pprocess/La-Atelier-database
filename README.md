# La-atelier-database
<h4>2024W 1st semester frontend project - lambton college</h4>
<br>
This is a simple database of a rental website made as a database project by me and my buddies. It is only a mockup website and doesn't contain real-world practical design and has SQL files for creating, inserting, and manipulating data, and has documentation like ERD, business rules, and other documentation for the database.
<br>
I acknowledge that this design has several flaws and could have been a lot better, but it does our job on our 1st try so why not :)
